                    <p>My name is Kaleb Carter and I am a web developer that also has an interest in data science. This past year, I graduated from the University of Oklahoma
                        with a degree in Accounting and Management Information Systems, but recently I have developed a growing interest for software engineering in these past few months. 
                        So, I decided to use this time of economic hardship to learn a new skill and excel at the task, and I have loved every second of the journey.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I made this site to showcase some of my projects that I have been working on while I learn. Currently, I am working towards both proficiency and to excel in the following 
                        languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python. My goal is to work as a full-stack web developer and become an expert in the craft. As I believe my contribution I could be able to make at an organization
                        would be significant even with my lack of experience due to my ability to learn and adapt.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>If you wish to contact me for any reason at all, whether you're an employer, fellow coder looking to collaborate on a project, or just want to talk, shoot me a text, email, or give me a call! I am always looking to help and work on projects 
                        to improve myself!
